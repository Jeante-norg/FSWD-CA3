  ----------------------  
  ðŸ“Œ Complete Assignment - High - Due: 2025-03-20  
  ðŸ“Œ Grocery Shopping - Medium - Due: 2025-03-22  
  ðŸ“Œ Call the Bank - Low - Due: 2025-03-25  
  ```

### ðŸ”¹ **Task Item**  
- Each task should be displayed as a separate entry with:  
  - **Task Title**  
  - **Priority Level (High, Medium, Low)**  
  - **Due Date**  

- Example individual output:  
  ```  
  ðŸ“Œ Grocery Shopping - Medium - Due: 2025-03-22  
  ```

  - Task Title  
  - Priority Level (Dropdown: High, Medium, Low)  
  - Due Date  
- A **Submit Button** should be present.  
- On clicking submit, the inputted values should be captured.  

---  

## ðŸ“Œ **Technical Constraints**  
- The project must be built using **React components**.  
- Components should be structured properly.  
- Styling should be applied for **better readability and UI consistency**.

    - An input field for the task title.
    - A dropdown for selecting priority (High, Medium, Low).
    - An input field for the due date.
    - A Submit button to add the task.
